# Exoplanet Detection with Machine Learning

This project aims to detect exoplanets using machine learning techniques, leveraging data from Caltech and NASA.

## Project Overview
The goal is to build a machine learning model to classify candidates as confirmed exoplanets or false positives. The dataset contains information on various observed parameters of exoplanet candidates, such as their radius, temperature, orbital characteristics, and others.

## Models Used
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Used initially and optimized for better performance.
- **Logistic Regression**: Evaluated as an additional classifier.
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Used to compare performance with other models.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 90%. Further details on precision, recall, and feature importance can be found in the notebook.

## Acknowledgements
The code structure, comments, and language have been reviewed and improved using ChatGPT to ensure clarity and correctness.
